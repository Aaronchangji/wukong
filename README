1.compile and sync to other machine

	cd tools;
	make graph_distributed;
	./sync.sh;

	Currently, only graph_distributed version is working.

2.run 	

	./run_dist.sh 6 config

	6 is machine number, config is the config file

3.config file 

	global_use_rbf : rdma write as message passing interface; 0 means use zeroMQ instead
	global_use_rdma : use rdma read to directly read vertex in next level 
	global_rdma_threshold : if vertex number larger than threshold, use message passing
	global_batch_factor : on the flying requests number
	global_input_folder: nfs folder or local folder of input data
	global_interactive: iteractive mode or batch mode
		iteractive 	mode : only one request at a time.
		batch 		mode : execute a lot of requests and calculate the throughput
	global_rdftype_id : id of the predict rdf:type . in LUBM benchmark , it's 0
	global_use_loc_cache : cache header of remote vertex
	global_num_lubm_university : used in batch mode 
	global_load_convert_format: use convert_format can speedup loading
		in default format, every machine will load all files , and only keep the useful part
		in convert_format, every machine only need to load its own part, 
							so the files can locate at local folder, 
							determined by global_input_folder
	global_load_minimal_index: 
		index_subject can be very large, it slow down the loading phase and use a lot of memory.
		we use a subset of index_subject to solve this problem
